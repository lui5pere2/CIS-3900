      I plan on strengthining the software indstry in not only Grand Rapids, but the West Michigan area. I am currently studying at Western Michigan University in Information Systems, where I'll graduate in the spring of 2018. I've been fortunate to have had
      opportunities to build a core tech and entrepreneurship. I plan on continuing with tech entrepreneurship, even if that means bringing my skillsets into a corporate environment..
